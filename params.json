The campaign is conducive to\r\nsocial sharing and has prize levels based on the number of people each person\r\nrefers. By default, we've included our original HTML/CSS for both the site and\r\nemail to give you a better idea of how this looked when actually running.\r\n\r\n## Mechanics\r\n\r\nPrelaunchr has a main mechanic from which everything else is derived: Every\r\n`User` is given a unique `referral_code` which is how the application knows who\r\nreferred a signing up user. Based on the amount of referrals a `User` has\r\nbrought to the site, they are put into a different \"prize group\". The groups,\r\namounts, and prizes are completely up to you to set.\r\n\r\n## IP Blocking\r\n\r\nBy default, we block more than 2 sign-ups from the same IP address. This was\r\nsimplistic, but was good enough for us during our campaign. If you want\r\nsomething more substantial take a look at [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developer Setup\r\n\r\nGet Ruby 2.3.0 (rbenv), bundle and install:\r\n\r\n```no-highlight\r\nbrew update && brew upgrade ruby-build && rbenv install 2.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nClone the repo and enter the folder (commands not shown).\r\n\r\nInstall Bundler, Foreman and Mailcatcher then Bundle:\r\n\r\n```no-highlight\r\ngem install bundler foreman mailcatcher\r\nbundle\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy the local `database.yml` file sample and `.env.sample`:\r\n\r\n```no-highlight\r\ncp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml\r\ncp .env.sample .env\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate your newly created .env file with the needed configuration\r\nDEFAULT\\_MAILER\\_HOST: sets the action mailer default host as seen in\r\nconfig/environment/<environment>.rb. You will minimally need this in production.\r\nSECRET\\_KEY\\_BASE: sets a secret key to be used by config/initializers/devise.rb\r\n\r\nSetup your local database:\r\n\r\n```no-highlight\r\nbundle exec rake db:create\r\nbundle exec rake db:migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart local server and mail worker:\r\n\r\n```no-highlight\r\nforeman start -f Procfile.dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nView your website at the port default `http://localhost:5000/`.\r\nView sent mails at `http://localhost:1080/`.\r\n\r\n### To create an admin account\r\n\r\nIn Rails console, run this command. Be careful to not use the example admin user\r\nfor security reasons. Password confirmation should match password.\r\n\r\n`AdminUser.create!(:email => 'admin@example.com', :password => 'password', :password_confirmation => 'passwordconfirmaiton')`\r\n\r\nYou can run this locally in a Rails console for development testing.\r\n\r\nIf you are deployed to Heroku, you would run it there.\r\n\r\n## Teardown\r\n\r\nWhen your prelaunch campaign comes to an end we've included a helpful `rake`\r\ntask to help you compile the list of winners into CSV's containing the email\r\naddresses and the amount of referrals the user had.\r\n\r\n* Run `bundle exec rake prelaunchr:create_winner_csvs` and the app will export\r\nCSV's in `/lib/assets` corresponding to each prize group.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n* Set the different prize levels on the `User::REFERRAL_STEPS` constant inside\r\n`/app/models/user.rb`\r\n* The `config.ended` setting in `/config/application.rb` decides whether the\r\nprelaunch campaign has ended or not (e.g. Active/Inactive). We've included this\r\noption so you can quickly close the application and direct users to your newly\r\nlaunched site.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe code, documentation, non-branded copy and configuration are released under\r\nthe MIT license.
